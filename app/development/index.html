With help from a local police detective (played by Tcheky Karyo), Tony embarks on an obsessive quest to find his son and those responsible for his disappearance. A gripping puzzle with twists and turns at every stage, Tony's exhaustive search fractures his relationship with his wife, Emily (played by Frances O'Connor), and threatens to destroy his life.

    <p class="tmColor1">A riveting and haunting character-driven drama, "The Missing" centers on a desperate eight-year search to find a young boy who suddenly disappears while on holiday in France with his loving parents. While the overarching premise is the actual search for a missing child, the story's compelling narrative examines the intense psychological and emotional toll that one tragic event can have on a family, a community and even law enforcement, whose professional entanglement takes a very personal turn as they seek answers and justice. The gripping, eight-episode STARZ Limited Series also deals with the raw emotions associated with such terrible loss and explores how obsession, excruciating guilt and the chance to redeem one's self can cause a person to lose everything and everyone that they've ever cared for. </p>

    <p class="tmColor1">It's the summer of 2006 and the Hughes family, Tony, Emily and five-year-old Oliver, are left stranded in the quaint and beautiful town of Châlons Du Bois when their car fails unexpectedly. But Tony (played by Irish actor James Nesbitt) and Emily (played by Australian actress Frances O'Connor) choose to embrace the moment and check into a family-run hotel while they wait for repairs to be completed. The town is abuzz with World Cup frenzy and Tony takes Oliver – nicknamed "Olly" - to a local bar where enthusiastic spectators are engrossed in TV screens broadcasting the quarter final match between France and Brazil. Tony and Olly make their way through the exuberant crowd, and as a goal is scored cheers fill the air... and in that moment, Tony realizes his son is gone. Vanished, without a trace. </p>

    <p class="tmColor1">The Hughes' lives are turned upside down. Emily is inconsolable; Tony is stricken by a sense of helplessness and yet they must grapple with Olly's disappearance while navigating a country and language that are foreign to them in every sense of the word. A media frenzy ensues, adding to the chaos, as new suspects in the disappearance emerge at every corner. </p>

    <p class="tmColor1">Executive producer Willow Grylls says, "In the briefest of moments, an environment that felt happy for the Hughes family becomes nightmarish as they attempt to find their son in a country where they neither understand the language nor the rules." </p>

    <p class="tmColor1">The psychological fallout and exhaustive manhunt unfolds over two different time frames, 2006 and 2014. Viewers are presented with clues from both the past and the present that could lead the family and police to uncover what has happened to young Olly. </p>

    <p class="tmColor1">Grylls continues: "It is a story that takes place in a world that's familiar which quickly becomes unfamiliar. </p>

    <p class="tmColor1">That dynamic drives tension through the whole piece. Director Tom Shankland says that he "wanted it to be fundamentally quite authentic and naturalistic so the audience would see the world through the eyes of the characters."</p>
